# Ruby Sample Code
:exclamation:
This repository is a barebones sample implementation of Nutrient Document Converter Services (formerly Muhimbi PDF Converter Services), built purely with demo purposes in mind. This example has not been designed to run unmodified in production.

Details about using the *[Muhimbi PDF Converter Services](http://www.muhimbi.com/Products/PDF-Converter-Services/summary.aspx)* from Ruby (on Rails) can be found here. Further information, including the object model, can be found [in the Developer Guide](http://www.muhimbi.com/support/documentation/PDF-Converter-Services/User---Developer-Guide.aspx) and in the [Muhimbi Knowledge Base](https://support.muhimbi.com/hc/en-us/sections/206267927-PDF-Converter-Web-Service-Interface).

A detailed blog post, including details about how to setup Ruby, including all prerequisites, can be found on our [Blog](http://blog.muhimbi.com/2013/03/use-ruby-on-rails-to-convert-merge-and.html).

## Sample Code

Sample code, and related files, for the various facilities provided by the service can be found below. It is recommended to copy all samples to your local system using one of the following options:

- **Git:** Use the following command to clone the entire repository to your system.

- **SVN:** A common trick to download only part of a Git repository  is to use `svn`. Download only the Java client and sample code using the following command.<br>

     `svn export https://github.com/Muhimbi/PDF-Converter-Services/trunk/Ruby`
