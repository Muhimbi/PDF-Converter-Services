### Building and Running the Sample Code

Open the solution file in Visual Studio

If the sample code is executed on the same server that runs the Muhimbi Conversion Service, then no changes are required.

If the conversion service is located on a different machine, then change the `SERVICE_URL` as defined in `program.cs`, and replace `localhost` to the name or address of the server running the conversion service.


With the change made, press `CTRL+F5` to build and run the application. After a few seconds the processed file will be opened in your system's PDF reader.
