# Apply rich watermarks to a PDF using C#
:exclamation:
This repository is a barebones sample implementation of Nutrient Document Converter Services (formerly Muhimbi PDF Converter Services), built purely with demo purposes in mind. This example has not been designed to run unmodified in production.

The C# sample provided in this section uses the *[Muhimbi PDF Converter Services](http://www.muhimbi.com/Products/PDF-Converter-Services/summary.aspx)* to apply a watermark (a.k.a Stamping) to a PDF file. (It converts the input file to PDF first if needed.)

Specifically, a 'Confidential' watermark across the first page of the document, and page numbering on the remaining pages, using a differently aligned page number on odd and even pages. 

For background details about applying watermarks to PDF Files using C#, see [this Blog post](http://blog.muhimbi.com/2010/06/using-awesome-new-watermarking-features.html).

Additional sample code to convert, merge, watermark, secure and OCR files [can be found here](../).

### Building and Running the Sample Code

Open the solution file in Visual Studio.

If the sample code is executed on the same server that runs the Muhimbi Conversion Service, then no changes are required.

If the conversion service is located on a different machine, then change the `SERVICE_URL` as defined in `program.cs`, and change `localhost` to the name or address of the server running the conversion service.


With the change made, press `CTRL+F5` to build and run the application. After a few seconds the watermarked PDF will be opened in your system's default PDF viewer.
