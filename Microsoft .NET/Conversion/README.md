# Convert a document to PDF using C#
:exclamation:
This repository is a barebones sample implementation of Nutrient Document Converter Services (formerly Muhimbi PDF Converter Services), built purely with demo purposes in mind. This example has not been designed to run unmodified in production.

The C# sample provided in this section uses the *[Muhimbi PDF Converter Services](http://www.muhimbi.com/Products/PDF-Converter-Services/summary.aspx)* to convert a file to PDF. Additional sample code to convert, merge, watermark, secure and OCR files [can be found here](../).

For background details about converting files to PDF using C#, see [this Blog post](http://blog.muhimbi.com/2009/12/converting-office-files-to-pdf-format.html).

### Building and Running the Sample Code

Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2017 or newer, and press `CTRL+F5` to build and run the application.

If the sample code is executed on the same server that runs the Muhimbi Conversion Service, then no changes are required. Just browse for a file using the `...` button, and click `Convert / Process file`.

If the conversion service is located on a different machine then click the `WS Configure` tab and change `localhost` to the name or address of the server running the conversion service.
