## Prerequisites

Using the PDF Converter in combination with Java requires JDK 7 or later. Exact deployment and configuration steps for the various platforms vary slightly.

:exclamation:
Please make sure that a copy of the Muhimbi PDF Converter Services ([Download](http://www.muhimbi.com/Products/PDF-Converter-Services/Free-Trial.aspx)) is installed on at least one Windows Server in your environment. (Don't worry, it can be invoked from non-Windows platforms including Linux).
:exclamation:

<br/>

### Linux

There are multiple options for compiling and executing Java code on Linux. The examples provided in this section have been tested with Ubuntu 18.0.4 and Java versions 7 to 11 using both OpenJDK and Oracle Java. For example, install the OpenJDK version of Java 8 as follows:

```
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless
```

<br/>

:exclamation:If you wish to use Java 11 then we recommend using Maven to build the project. The Java EE Modules (including javax.xml.ws) have been removed from the standard Java SDK as of version 11. Scripts for compiling and running with Maven are supplied along the `pom.xml` file.:exclamation:

```
sudo apt install maven
```

<br/>

### Windows

For Windows developers we recommend using [Oracle's official JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). The examples provided in this section have been tested on Windows with this JDK.

<br/>

## Sample Code

Sample code, and related files, for the various facilities provided by the service can be found below. It is recommended to copy all samples to your local system using one of the following options:

- **Git:** Use the following command to clone the entire repository to your system. This will download all files associated with this repository, and is most likely overkill, but it is the only easy way to download files using Git. Once downloaded, you can find the examples under the `Java` folder.<br>
   
     `git clone https://github.com/Muhimbi/PDF-Converter-Services/`

- **SVN:** A common trick to download only part of a Git repository  is to use `svn`. Download only the Java client and sample code using the following command.<br>

     `svn export https://github.com/Muhimbi/PDF-Converter-Services/trunk/Java`

- **ZIP:** [Download](https://github.com/Muhimbi/PDF-Converter-Services/zipball/master/) a ZIP archive of the entire repository. Once downloaded, you can find the examples under the `Java` folder.
